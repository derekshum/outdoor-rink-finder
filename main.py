# Toronto Open Data is stored in a CKAN instance. It's APIs are documented here:
# https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/api/

# To hit our API, you'll be making requests to:
base_url = "https://ckan0.cf.opendata.inter.prod-toronto.ca"

# Datasets are called "packages". Each package can contain many "resources"
# To retrieve the metadata for this package and its resources, use the package name in this page's URL:
url = base_url + "/api/3/action/package_show"
params = { "id": "outdoor-artificial-ice-rinks"}
package = requests.get(url, params = params).json()

# To get resource data:
for idx, resource in enumerate(package["result"]["resources"]):

       # for datastore_active resources:
       if resource["datastore_active"]:

           # To get all records in CSV format:
           url = base_url + "/datastore/dump/" + resource["id"]
           resource_dump_data = requests.get(url).text
           print(resource_dump_data)

           # To selectively pull records and attribute-level metadata:
           url = base_url + "/api/3/action/datastore_search"
           p = { "id": resource["id"] }
           resource_search_data = requests.get(url, params = p).json()["result"]
           print(resource_search_data)
           # This API call has many parameters. They're documented here:
           # https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/datastore.html

       # To get metadata for non datastore_active resources:
       if not resource["datastore_active"]:
           url = base_url + "/api/3/action/resource_show?id=" + resource["id"]
           resource_metadata = requests.get(url).json()
           print(resource_metadata)
           # From here, you can use the "url" attribute to download this file
