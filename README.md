This is a small project to explore PFR's datasets. As of November 28, 2024, it locates the spatially closest out door ice rink to a set of given coordinates.

Planned enhancements:
- Containerize
- Utilize pgRouting to find distance along streets for various modes of transport
- Query Google Maps' API to allow address entry
- Make a more friendly UI
